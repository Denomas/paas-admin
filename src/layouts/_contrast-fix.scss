// There is an issue, where all elements provided by the govuk-frontend will
// have a yellow background set on :focus. It's particularly affecting links,
// buttons and summary boxes. These elements also have a blue text in them,
// which could cause difficulty to our users when it comes to reading the
// content. It means we don't meet the required WCAG 2 AA standard [1].

// Design system team thinks the roll out may take a long time, due to the
// nature of it being used in the wide government and have no issues with
// us overriding it with the provided black colour.

// This is only a temporary solution and should be reverted back once the
// issue upstream is resolved. [2]
