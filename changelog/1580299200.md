As a result of tenants' feedback and improving observability on the platform,
we have recently added backing service metrics to the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool.
This is a new feature, under active development, so you may notice some changes
in the coming weeks.

We'll be looking to add more metrics based upon user feedback so feel free to
get in touch.

The metrics that are available for each backing service are:

**PostgreSQL and MySQL**

* Free disk space
* CPU Utilisation
* Database Connections
* Freeable Memory
* Read/Write IOPS

**Elasticsearch**

* Load average
* Indices count
* Memory usage
* Disk usage
* Disk read/write rate
* Network in/out

**Redis**

* CPU Utilisation
* Memory used
* Swap memory used
* Evictions
* Connection count
* Cache hits/misses
* Item count
* Network bytes in/out

**CDN route**

* Requests
* Total error rate
* 4xx and 5xx error rate
* Bytes uploaded/downloaded

In the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool, go to your Space and select the "Metrics" tab for
your backing service to view the dashboards. These metrics are also available
for download in CSV format.
