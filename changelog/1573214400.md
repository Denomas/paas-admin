We now offer database plans with **PostgreSQL 11** and **MySQL 8.0**. These
database engines include various performance improvements and new features.

These new plans have at least 100GB of storage, which makes some more expensive
but gives better disk performance. You can see the details of these new plans by
running `cf marketplace -s postgres` or `cf marketplace -s mysql`. The cost
difference can be seen at

or

Existing PostgreSQL 10 and MySQL 5.7 databases can be updated using the
`cf update-service` command. However, existing PostgreSQL 9.5 databases cannot
be automatically updated due to compatibility issues with PostGIS. If that is a
problem for you then please let us know.
